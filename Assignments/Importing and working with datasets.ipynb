    "#### <u>Assignment 1: Reading csv-file to a Pandas DataFrame in Jupyter Notebook</u> <a id=\"a1\"></a>\n",
    "Data comes from a source, and in this example, you are to work with data stored in a csv-file. Your\n",
    "assignment is to collect a set of data from the internet, save it in your project directory or in a\n",
    "preferred folder, and read it to a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new ipynb-file and name it “housingtest”.\n",
    "2. Navigate to following GitHub - <a>https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2</a> , clone or download the repository to your PC. When done, you will find a folder named “datasets”. The folder contains different datasets stored as CSV-files. First, we will be working with *housing*.csv (house prices) and later on in other assignments *oecd_bli_2015.csv* (life satisfaction). Note: I downloaded to local C:\\ drive and then copied the whole Github-project to my *OneDrive Zealand*, as Anaconda has directly access to the *OneDrive Zealand* from the project repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*You now have two options:*\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*A. Copy the housing.csv directly to your Jupyter project folder, or*\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*B. Access it from the folder, holding the cloned/downloaded GitHub repository.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. First Option A: Upload the housing.csv to your solutions-folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "Click “Upload” on the right side of the screen <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L3h6ldr.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Your file-explorer will now appear. Navigate to your repository. Here you will find a folder named\n",
    "“datasets”. The folder contains different datasets stored as CSV-files. <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/koDcikh.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the housing file, it will now appear in your Jupyter folder.\n",
    "Then you must click *Upload*. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/77dMMTT.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In Jupyter, first create a new Notebook.\n",
    "In first cell import pandas (pd) as done previously. Then declare a variable to hold the data by using\n",
    "the pandas’ pd.read_csv function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you saved the CSV-file in your project folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "housing = pd.read_csv(‘housing.csv’)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV-file is now ready to be stored in a data frame. Simply create a DataFrame object as you\n",
    "did in the previous assignment and let it take your data variable as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(housing)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame you just created contains a lot of data. In order to see just a small fraction call the\n",
    "head() function. It will show you the top five results by default, but you can give an optional\n",
    "number as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should look like this. <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jn9zNN7.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Second Option B: If you saved the CSV-file in another folder or directory then You have to\n",
    "specify the path to the .csv file in the folder datasets folder\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "housing1 = pd.read_csv(r'C:\\Users\\EASJ\\OneDrive……\\handson-ml2-master\\datasets\\housing\\housing.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to add the file name and extension, as the last part of the path.\n",
    "Then in the cell type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df1 = pd.DataFrame(housing1)\n",
    "print(df1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try to run, hopefully you get the same output as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPS: Did you forget the r’C:\\ ??\n"
